# Eduard GM

Iâ€™m a physics undergraduate at UCM with a growing focus on quantitative finance, data-driven analysis, and computational modeling. Iâ€™m building a strong foundation in numerical methods, statistics, and modern tools for data science and algorithmic trading.

## Current Focus

- Time series analysis and financial data modeling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python  
- Portfolio returns, volatility, and risk metrics  
- Working with libraries such as:
  - `yfinance`, `NumPy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn` for statistical modeling and preprocessing
  - `statsmodels` for regression and time series methods  
  - `Plotly` for interactive visualizations  

## Learning Objectives

- Sharpen my Python development for applied finance  
- Study quantitative trading strategies (momentum, mean reversion)  
- Explore fundamentals of portfolio theory and factor models  
- Develop clean, reproducible Jupyter workflows  
- Apply concepts from machine learning (e.g., classification, clustering) to market behavior

## Projects

- ðŸ“ˆ [`msft-30day-analysis`](https://github.com/Eduard-GM/msft-30day-analysis):  
  30-day technical analysis of Microsoft stock (MSFT), including SMA/EMA, log returns, volatility, and RSI metrics. Full analysis in Jupyter Notebook with visual output and summary interpretation.

More projects coming soon â€” including a GitHub-based quantitative finance portfolio and notebooks focused on data preprocessing, prediction models, and strategy backtesting.
